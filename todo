__strain designer__
find homologous genes for an enzyme when one cannot be found for a given org
find biobrick standard sequences to combine with enzyme genes (as the biobrick part)
choose software to display the completed plasmid(s) to user after construction
add option for user to select type of plasmid (from biobrick parts) to place genes on
optimize codon usage for target organism

__imptools v2__
if a gene cannot be found for a rxn's enzyme, cannot use this rxn in the pathway
implement rpair in database so paths are more logical
add pathweighting to favor 'more common' reagents and rxns which use previous 'sideeffect' products
make paths non-linear -- can include side rxns to produce reagents for rxns on the 'main path'
